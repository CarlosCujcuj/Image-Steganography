# Image Steganography

On different occasions, people want to store data in some safe way or in a safe place where it is difficult for others to access. Many people save valuable data like **sensitive/important text**, **Passwords** or **Seed Phrase** of a wallet in an Excel file, txt File or even block notes, which is obviously insecure.

The purpose of this project is to create a way of saving valuable information in images by using the technique called [Steganography](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/steganography) which basically is **hiding secret data within an ordinary, non-secret, file or message in order to avoid detection; the secret data is then extracted at its destination.** 

## General Idea
With this script you can hide *text files* and *images* within other images and later send them to someone as a typical image. They can only see the hidden content if they know the a key (*pattern*) of how you save the secret info within the image.

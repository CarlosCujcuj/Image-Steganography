# Image Steganography

The purpose of this project is to make use of the technique called [Steganography](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/steganography) which basically is **hiding secret data within an ordinary, non-secret, file or message in order to avoid detection; the secret data is then extracted at its destination.**
